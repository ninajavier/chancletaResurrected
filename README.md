## Installation and Getting Started:

* *npm install* to install any dependencies 
* *npm start* to run react in http://localhost:3000


## Goals:

## Git Commands

* git clone https://github.com/ninajavier/Chancleta to create a copy of a Git repository in a new directory on your local machine.

* git remote add upstream https://github.com/ninajavier/Chancleta (only for the first time): This command sets up a remote connection to the original repository that you forked from. This is only required once when you start working with a new fork.

* git fetch upstream: This command fetches the changes made in the original repository since the last time you fetched changes.

* git checkout main: This command switches to the main branch of your forked repository.

* git merge upstream/main: This command merges the changes from the original repository's main branch into your main branch.

* git checkout <testing_branch>: This command switches to the testing branch where you want to apply the changes.

* git merge main: This command merges the changes from your main branch into your testing branch.

* git add .: This command adds all the changes made in the testing branch to the staging area.

* git commit: This command commits the changes made in the testing branch with a message describing the changes.

* git push: This command pushes the changes made in the testing branch to your GitHub repository.

Make a pull request to the original repository: This step involves going to the original repository and creating a pull request with the changes made in the testing branch of your forked repository. This allows the original repository to review your changes and potentially merge them into their repository.

## Order Of Operations:

1. git fetch upstream (to get all updated changes)
2. Go to your branch
3. Make changes in your branch
4. Add and Commit from your branch
5. git checkout main
6. git pull
7. git checkout <your-branch-name>
8. git merge
